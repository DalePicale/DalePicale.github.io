<center>Welcome to a site about....

<h1>LD!!!!</h1>

the greatest person in the world</center><br><br><br>


<b>Explanation:</b><br><br>

LD is the greatest person in the world. He beated Dark Hourse at Super Smash Bros., which is pretty good. LD is like 25 years old, lives in Baltimore and his real name is something abut an Abacus or whatnot, I can't really make it out from that interview.<br>
<br> LD is an emo. I bet he listens to Fugazi all day. He also has a girlfriend. I don't, and neither does Harambe. John however, does have a girlfriend, but I have never met her.<br><br>

LD can beat everybody at Super Smash Bros. He plays Fox, but I bet he can beat everybody with every character. However, there are two players he can't beat at Smash, namely Derek and The Z. Here are the real rankings when it comes to Super Smash Bros. worldwide:<br><br>

<b>
1. Derek<br>
2. Zenyore<br>
3. LD<br>
4. Isai<br>
5. Sheers (not Shear he's lame)<br>
6. Harambe<br><br>

...big gap...<br><br>

7. Ken<br>
8. SuPeRbroomfan (he says he's number 8 but we don't believe him lol)<br><br>

...big gap, again...<br><br>

9. Alvin (not that singing chipmunk)<br>
10. The Rest (I mean every other player, not a player who named himself after that Jiggly attack lol)<br>
11. Mew2King<br>
12. Apparition<br><br>
</b>

Mew2King thinks he is so great. Well, perhaps he is, but certainly not as great as LD. LD can beat Mew2King anytime he wants. He can beat Mew2King with one hand and blindfolded. That's how great LD is.<br><br>

<center>Here's a picture of LD<br><br>

He looks all emo, but u know what? i don't care. Because I know what LDs really like and that's what it's all about.<br><br>

There also is a special move called 'the LD'. It has something to do with the Firefox (not the browser lol). Speaking of Browser, I bet LD can beat unlock Bowser for smash 64 because hes just that good. Too bad LD always sandbags. Anyway if u want to know how to do an LD me and Matt will make a movie to explain it sometime aight? Respect.<br><br>

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsD8erPf0YA">video 3</a><br><br>




Some people say LD is gay but they don't know what they're are talking about. I once talked to LD about this and he said that if you say that he's gay u r actually gay urself so there u have it n00bs!!!!11!<br><br>

People wonder what LD's real name is or what LD stands for.  I heard that it stands for 'Laser Dicks' or 'Long Dong'.  Maybe it even stands for Lame Douche.  His real name is an enigma though.  I heared that brother stud drank with Mama LD and found out his real name!!!! But it might forever be a mystery.  
<br><br>
Here's a list of people who are inferior to LD:<br><br>

- Tommy ControllersuckSpezoli<br>
- MATTS!<br>
- Mew2King<br>
- JoJo Spezoli<br>
- Apparition (he's pretty cool but what's with those outfits I mean come on....)<br>
- Isai<br>
- Tacos (both the food and the player)<br>
- Rizner (Aka Apparition)<br>
- Me<br>
- And many many more...<br><br>

I met Beef Sanchez a couple of days ago but I forgot to ask him what he thinks of LD since he has actually met LD in person!!!!<br><br>

If LD ever comes to Europe I just have to team up with him. It's inevitable. I would easily give all my money to LD if he used it to go to Europe. Then I could team up with him and we would be invincible. LD if u read this please contact me so we can team up I just can't wait. My name is Donkey Dong and I have an account on Smash World Forums so u know where to find me.<br><br>

Finally if you want to get the latest news about Abacus Zilch u can sign up for the LD newsletter soon!!!11!!<br><br>

So that's about it. If u don't think that LD is the greatest person ever, well...just screw you.<br><br>
